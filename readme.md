This module compliments the https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor

Once it is installed on your site with behat_editor you can begin to

 * Add your own custom steps
 * Add ui elements to the graphical form for writing tests
 * write tests offline and upload them via whatever deploy system you have

You can see a lot of info in the behat_editor readme.md

Otherwise there are some comments in the behat_editor_example.module to get you going on the form. And there is a link in the behat_editor_example.behat.inc file to the DrupalExtension module which describes how to build out custom steps.
